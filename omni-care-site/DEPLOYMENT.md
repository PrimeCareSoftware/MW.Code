# Omni Care Site - Deployment Guide

## Overview

The omni-care-site is a marketing/landing page for the Omni Care platform built with:
- Vite
- React
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- shadcn/ui

## Automated Build Process

A GitHub Actions workflow automatically builds the site whenever changes are pushed to:
- The `main` branch
- The `omni-care-site/` directory

The workflow is defined in `.github/workflows/deploy-omni-care-site.yml`.

### Build Artifacts

After each successful build, the compiled static files are saved as artifacts in GitHub Actions for 30 days. These artifacts are ready to be deployed to any static hosting provider.

## Deployment Options

### Option 1: Lovable Platform (Recommended for Lovable Projects)

Since this project was created with Lovable, you can deploy directly through their platform:

3. Your site will be deployed automatically

To connect a custom domain:
1. Navigate to Project > Settings > Domains
2. Click "Connect Domain"
3. Follow the instructions to configure your DNS

1. Build the site locally or download from GitHub Actions artifacts
2. Upload the contents of the `dist` folder to your web server's public directory
3. Configure your web server (Apache/Nginx) to serve the static files

Example Nginx configuration:
```nginx
server {
    listen 80;

- Ensure all dependencies are installed: `npm ci`
- Check Node.js version: should be 20.x

### Changes not reflecting on the live site
- Ensure you're deploying the latest build from the main branch
- Clear your browser cache or try incognito mode
- Check if your hosting platform has automatic deployments enabled
